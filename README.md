The goal of the app is to create a website where you can watch TV shows, movies, and anime. There will be a reward system that allows you to earn credit or virtual currency.
The application will be free, but it will generate revenuew from user watching adds. The website will fowllow a 80-10-10 model. 80% of the revenue will be use to get more content, 10% will be use for maintance of the website, and 10% will be give back to the charity of choice of the community. 

The main idea is to have the screen split into two screen one where you can selected a show. The bottom screen will be used to select Ads to earn credits or virtual currency.
